# Accumulate Lite Wallet - Open Source Core

A stripped-down, open-source foundation for building Accumulate blockchain wallets. This project provides the essential UI components, business logic, and blockchain integration needed to create a functional Accumulate wallet.

## 🎯 What's Included

### ✅ Core Wallet Features
- **Dashboard UI** - Balance display, transaction history, charts
- **Transaction Management** - Send/receive tokens, staking interfaces
- **Multi-Signature Support** - Complete signing workflow and delegation
- **Voting Interface** - Governance participation tools
- **QR Code Integration** - Address scanning and generation
- **Accumulate API** - Full blockchain integration
- **Cryptographic Utilities** - Key management and signing

### ✅ Clean Architecture
- **Pure Dart Business Logic** - No Flutter dependencies in core
- **Provider State Management** - Reactive UI updates
- **Service Locator Pattern** - Dependency injection
- **Modular Feature Structure** - Easy to extend and maintain

## ❌ What's NOT Included (You Need to Implement)

- **User Authentication** - No login/registration system
- **Data Persistence** - No local database or storage
- **Background Services** - No automatic polling or sync
- **Push Notifications** - No FCM or notification system
- **User Onboarding** - No account creation flow

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Flutter 3.3.1 or higher
- Dart SDK
- Git

### Installation

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd accumulate-lite-wallet-OS
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

The app will launch with a placeholder authentication screen showing what needs to be implemented.

## 🛠 Implementation Guide

### 1. Authentication (Required)
Implement user authentication and identity management:

```dart
// You need to implement:
- User registration/login
- Mnemonic phrase generation
- Key derivation and storage
- Identity creation on Accumulate
```

**See: [docs/AUTHENTICATION.md](docs/AUTHENTICATION.md)**

### 2. Data Persistence (Required)
Choose and implement a storage solution:

```dart
// Options:
- SQLite (sqflite)
- Hive
- Shared Preferences
- Remote database
```

**See: [docs/PERSISTENCE.md](docs/PERSISTENCE.md)**

### 3. Configuration (Required)
Set up your environment and endpoints:

```dart
// Configure in lib/config/app_config.dart:
- Network endpoints (mainnet/testnet)
- API keys and settings
- Feature flags
```

**See: [docs/CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md)**

### 4. Optional Enhancements
Extend with additional features:

```dart
// Consider adding:
- Background sync
- Push notifications
- Cloud backup
- Multi-device support
```

**See: [docs/SERVICES.md](docs/SERVICES.md)**

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

This wallet uses a clean architecture pattern:

1. **Core Layer** - Pure Dart business logic
2. **Feature Layer** - UI components organized by feature
3. **Shared Layer** - Reusable components and utilities

### Key Services

- `AccumulateApiService` - Blockchain API integration
- `TokenSenderService` - Transaction submission
- `SignatureCountService` - Multi-sig management
- `CoreIdentityService` - Identity and key management

### State Management

Uses Provider pattern for reactive state:
- `DashboardProvider` - Account balances and data
- `TransactionsProvider` - Transaction management
- `PendingTxProvider` - Pending transaction tracking

## 🔧 Customization

### Theming
Modify `lib/shared/themes/app_theme.dart` to customize appearance.

### Network Configuration
Update `lib/config/app_config.dart` for different networks or endpoints.

### Feature Flags
Use `lib/config/feature_flags.dart` to enable/disable features.
